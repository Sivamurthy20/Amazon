# AmazonClone-Demo

This is a simple educational project that recreates the look and feel of the Amazon India website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is not a real shopping siteâ€”it's just for learning and portfolio purposes.

## Main Features
- Sticky header and navigation bar, similar to Amazon
- Demo sign-in page (no real login, just a mock UI)
- Search bar with category dropdown
- Language selector with flag
- Product grid with images, names, prices, and ratings
- Add to Cart button (works with localStorage for demo)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Dropdowns for Account & Lists, Cart Preview, and more

## How to use
Just open `index.html` in your browser. You can click around, add items to the cart, and see how the UI works. The login page is only for demonstration and does not collect any information.

## Disclaimer
This is not an official Amazon site. It is for educational use only. No real purchases, logins, or data collection happen here.
