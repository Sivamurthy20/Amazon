# 🛒 AmazonClone-Demo (Inspired by [Amazon.in](https://www.amazon.in))

This project is an educational front-end clone of the official Amazon India website. Some UI elements—such as the task bar, color scheme, and fonts—have been intentionally changed or customized in this clone for learning and demonstration purposes. No real data is collected or stored.
